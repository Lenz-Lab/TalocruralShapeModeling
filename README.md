Included is the dataset used to create statistical shape models utilizing ShapeWorks (https://github.com/SCIInstitute/ShapeWorks) to analyze talocrural morphology. Final segmented three-dimensional surface meshes (.ply) of weightbearing computed tomography (CT) images are included for the tibia, fibula and talus.  A sample weightbearing CT scan (.dicom) is provided to demonstrate image resolution, field of view and voxel size.  Additionally, the matlab code repository for calculating talocrural joint coverage, space and congruency is included with required files for duplicating the analysis.
